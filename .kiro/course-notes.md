# Course: Multi-Agent Systems and Protocol Integration on AWS

## The problem this course solves

A single agent degrades as scope grows: it handles one request type well, blurs on the second, and
hallucinates by the third. Prompting harder does not fix this — the fix is a smaller surface per model
plus an architecture that coordinates several of them. This course is the shift from "an agent" to "an
agent system": decomposing a problem into specialized agents, giving them a router, and giving them
shared context.

## Learning outcomes → what each one actually requires

| # | Outcome | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Design multi-agent architectures (hierarchical, flat, hybrid) with clear boundaries, communication paths, tradeoffs | no new AWS service — this is the design layer above everything else |
| 2 | Implement on Bedrock AgentCore + Strands Agents SDK, matching model to role (Nova Lite / Nova Pro / Claude) | Bedrock AgentCore, Strands Agents SDK |
| 3 | Orchestrate and route (sequential, parallel, conditional; content- and LLM-based routing; Saga-style state coordination) | DynamoDB, AgentCore Memory |
| 4 | Build multi-agent RAG with specialized retrievers | Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon S3 Vectors |
| 5 | Deploy to production | Bedrock Guardrails, AgentCore Gateway, CloudWatch + X-Ray, AgentCore Runtime versioning |

## Capstone: NovaMart

Fictional e-commerce company. Role: Enterprise AI Solutions Architect.

**Five agents:**
- Orchestrator — routes incoming work to the right specialist
- Inventory — order lookups
- Policy — policy questions; backed by parallel multi-agent RAG across **three** Bedrock Knowledge Bases
- Refund — refund decisions
- Communication — customer-facing responses

**Production surface:** AgentCore Runtime deployment, Bedrock Guardrails, session memory, CloudWatch +
X-Ray observability.

**What each piece is for, per the course framing:**
- Bedrock Guardrails — makes refusal predictable when the system should not take on a piece of work
- AgentCore Gateway — handles the handoff when agents pass control back and forth
- DynamoDB — shared memory across a long interaction, so agents do not lose the thread
